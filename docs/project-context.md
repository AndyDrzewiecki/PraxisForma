# GPT-5 Development Handoff: PraxisForma AI Coaching Platform

## üéØ **Your New Role**
You are now the **Lead AI Developer** for PraxisForma, an early-stage AI coaching platform for youth athletes. Your mission is to complete the MVP development and scale the technical infrastructure in Google Cloud Platform.

## üìã **Project Overview**
**Company**: PraxisForma LLC (Minnesota single-member LLC)  
**Founder**: Andrew Drzewiecki  
**Mission**: Democratize elite athletic coaching through AI-powered biomechanical analysis  
**Primary Users**: Youth athletes (12-18), coaches, parents  
**Business Model**: B2C subscriptions ($5-25/month) + B2B institutional licensing  

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture (Current State)**
### **What's Working:**
- **GCP Infrastructure**: Video Intelligence API integrated, cloud storage operational
- **Pose Detection**: 17-point landmark detection from video frames working
- **Basic Analysis**: Shoulder tilt, hip alignment, arm angle calculations implemented
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple video analysis pipeline functional
- **Data Pipeline**: Comprehensive landmark extraction and file management

### **Current Tech Stack:**
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform
- **AI/ML**: Video Intelligence API, custom Python biomechanical analysis
- **Storage**: GCP Cloud Storage bucket (`praxisforma-videos`)
- **Processing**: Python with batch video analysis capabilities
- **Data**: Timestamped pose landmark coordinates

## üéØ **Immediate Development Priorities**

### **Priority 1: Implement PQS Scoring Algorithm (CRITICAL)**
Transform basic biomechanical data into PraxisForma's proprietary **PowerQuotient Score (0-1000 points)**:

```python
def calculate_pqs(biomechanics_data):
    """
    PQS Components (1000 total points):
    - Shoulder Alignment: 0-150 points
    - Hip Rotation Efficiency: 0-200 points  
    - Release Angle Optimization: 0-250 points
    - Power Transfer Mechanics: 0-200 points
    - Footwork Timing: 0-100 points
    - Deductive Penalties: -0 to -300 points
    """
    base_score = 1000
    # Apply biomechanical analysis and deductions
    return final_pqs_score
```

### **Priority 2: Mobile-First Frontend (React Native)**
Build the core user flow:
1. **Video Capture Screen**: Guided recording with sport-specific tips
2. **Upload & Processing**: 30-second analysis with progress indicator  
3. **Results Display**: PQS score + encouraging feedback + visual overlays
4. **Progress Tracking**: Historical improvement charts

### **Priority 3: Privacy-First Processing**
- **Automatic face blurring** before any analysis
- **Body anonymization** removing identifying features
- **Local processing options** for sensitive users
- **COPPA/GDPR compliance** for youth data protection

### **Priority 4: AI Coaching Intelligence**
Convert technical biomechanical data into **youth-friendly coaching language**:
```
Technical: "Shoulder tilt 18.5 degrees"
Coaching: "Great power setup! Try keeping your shoulders more level during your windup - imagine balancing a book on each shoulder. This will help you transfer more energy into your throw! üí™"
```

## üîß **Current Code Base Summary**

You have two main Python files working in GCP:

### **File 1: `parse_analysis.py`**
- Parses existing analysis files
- Extracts high-confidence pose detections
- Calculates basic shoulder tilt and alignment
- Provides simple biomechanical feedback

### **File 2: `discus_analyzer_v2.py`**
- Complete video analysis pipeline
- Google Video Intelligence integration
- Batch processing capabilities
- Comprehensive landmark data extraction
- Basic biomechanical calculations (angles, tilts, alignment)

## üéÆ **Sport-Specific Requirements**

### **ThrowPro (Shot Put/Discus) - Current Focus**
**Movement Phases to Detect:**
1. **Setup**: Initial stance and preparation
2. **Windup**: Rotational preparation and hip loading
3. **Power Transfer**: Hip drive and shoulder coordination  
4. **Release**: Optimal angle and follow-through
5. **Recovery**: Balance and safety assessment

**Key Biomechanical Factors:**
- Shoulder levelness during rotation
- Hip-to-shoulder timing sequence
- Foot plant timing and angle
- Power transfer efficiency
- Release angle optimization (38-42¬∞ optimal for shot put)

### **Future Modules (LiftPro, SwingBot, etc.)**
Design modular architecture to easily add:
- **LiftPro**: LiftQuotient Score (LQS) for strength training
- **SwingBot**: Golf/baseball swing analysis
- **LaunchBot**: Jumping and plyometric analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è **Youth Safety & Privacy Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

### **Data Protection:**
- **Zero personal identification**: No face recognition, name storage, or identifying data
- **Local-first processing**: Option to analyze without cloud upload
- **Automatic anonymization**: All videos processed to remove identifying features
- **Parental controls**: Clear consent mechanisms for users under 18

### **Coaching Language:**
- **Always encouraging and constructive**
- **Age-appropriate terminology** (12-18 year olds)
- **Safety-first recommendations** 
- **Positive reinforcement patterns**
- **Never comparative/competitive language between athletes**

## üí∞ **Business Context**
