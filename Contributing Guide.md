Writing Good Tests
Test Naming Convention:
typescriptdescribe('PowerQuotientCalculator', () => {
  describe('calculatePQS', () => {
    it('should return score between 0-100 for valid biomechanical data', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should throw ValidationError for negative release angles', () => {
      // Test implementation  
    });
    
    it('should handle perfect technique scores correctly', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
Test Structure (AAA Pattern):
typescriptit('should process video with privacy protection enabled', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const mockVideo = createMockVideoFile();
  const options = { privacyProtection: true };
  
  // Act
  const result = await videoService.analyzeVideo(mockVideo, options);
  
  // Assert
  expect(result.privacyProtected).toBe(true);
  expect(result.personalDataRemoved).toBe(true);
});
