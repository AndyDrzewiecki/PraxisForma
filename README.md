1. Concept Summary
PraxisForma is a modular AI-based athletic coaching platform designed to provide real-time biomechanical analysis, scoring, and personalized corrective feedback for youth and amateur athletes. The platform leverages computer vision, machine learning, and domain-specific scoring models to evaluate performance and guide development.
Mission: To empower athletes, coaches, and parents with affordable, intelligent feedback tools that unlock individual performance potential through precision and form mastery.
Initial Product Lines:
•	ThrowPro: AI bot for throwing sports (shot put, discus)
•	LiftPro: AI bot for strength and resistance training
Each bot operates as an independent AI agent under the PraxisForma umbrella.

2. Scoring Systems and Intellectual Property
Each AI bot developed by PraxisForma will be governed by its own proprietary scoring system. These scoring frameworks are the intellectual core of each product and will be independently trademarked.
A. PQS – PowerQuotient Score
Used in ThrowPro, PQS is a biomechanical scoring model with a theoretical maximum of 1000 points, representing perfect biomechanical execution based on current world record–level movement.
Key Evaluation Factors:
•	Shoulder levelness and alignment
•	Hip rotation efficiency
•	Foot angle and sequence timing
•	Ground force usage and release posture
•	Deductive penalties for deviation from biomechanical ideal
B. LQS – LiftQuotient Score
Used in LiftPro, LQS analyzes lifting performance for key movements such as squats, deadlifts, and overhead lifts.
Key Evaluation Factors:
•	Stability and joint alignment
•	Tempo and eccentric/concentric timing
•	Range of motion completion
•	Bar path symmetry and hip/knee timing
•	Deductive penalties for unsafe or inefficient motion
Future bots will follow this same pattern: a named AI tool with an exclusive scoring framework.
Bot Name	Application Area	Scoring System Concept
ThrowPro	Throwing events	PQS (PowerQuotient Score)
LiftPro	Strength training	LQS (LiftQuotient Score)
RollBot	Bowling	TBD
AimBot	Darts	TBD
SwingBot	Baseball/Golf	TBD
LaunchBot	Jumps	TBD

5. Next Steps
•	Formal filing of trademarks: PraxisForma, PQS, ThrowPro, LQS, LiftPro
•	Draft provisional patent for scoring algorithm logic (starting with PQS)
•	Create NDA template for developers and partners
•	Register MN LLC and/or Portuguese LDA once development revenue or grant is pending
•	Begin prototyping PQS model using Azure tools post-AI-102 certification
