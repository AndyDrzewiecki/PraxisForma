Design role-based access control for coaches, athletes, parents, and administrators
Build audit logging for all data access and modifications for compliance reporting
Implement secure file upload with virus scanning and content validation
Create incident response procedures for potential data breaches or security issues

Youth Safety & Content Standards

Implement age-appropriate coaching language that is encouraging and constructive
Create anti-bullying protections in any social or communication features
Design parental oversight tools allowing parents to monitor their child's usage and progress
Build content moderation systems for any user-generated content or comments
Implement graduated training progressions preventing youth athletes from attempting advanced techniques prematurely
Create injury prevention warnings when analysis detects potentially harmful movement patterns

International & Localization Standards

Create comprehensive documentation for all APIs, algorithms, and coaching methodologies
Build automated testing pipelines covering unit, integration, and end-to-end scenarios
Use code review checklists specific to sports technology and youth safety considerations
Implement continuous deployment with automatic rollback capabilities for production issues

Final Mandate
Think critically about every suggestion from the perspectives of:

Youth Athlete Safety: Could this feature or implementation put young athletes at risk physically or emotionally?
Privacy Protection: Does this approach minimize data collection while maximizing coaching value?
Coaching Amplification: Will this feature make human coaches more effective rather than replace them?
Technical Excellence: Is this the most robust, scalable, and maintainable approach for a sports technology platform?
Business Sustainability: Does this implementation support both individual athletes and institutional customers effectively?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no" or "unclear," propose a better alternative that addresses all concerns while maintaining the core value proposition of democratizing elite athletic coaching through AI-powered biomechanical analysis.
Remember: We're not just building software - we're creating tools that will shape the athletic development and safety of youth athletes worldwide. Every line of code matters.
